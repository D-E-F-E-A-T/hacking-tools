This function will allow you to keep a webpage open continuously without bombing the user. It
will first open "https://www.wwwdotcom.com/" in internet explorer. Then the user will get confused
and close it, but it will immediately re-open internet explorer, and start the page again. Note the
"iexplore.exe" can be changed to any run command of your chosen browser...same with "www.wwwdotcom.com".
