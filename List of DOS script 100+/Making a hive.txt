When making a HIVE or a hidden folder so
all of the file that you virus creates can
operate freely without being seen by the user,
use this code shown down below:

Mkdir (Path)\(Name Of directory)
Attrib (Path)\(Name Of directory) +H +R

EXAMPLE:
=========

Mkdir C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\MyHIVE
Attrib C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\MyHIVE +H +R

NOTE:
=======

The "+R" is optional and it makes the file read only
so it can't be deleted or modified. The "+H" Obviously
makes it hidden. In any case you want to make it viewable,
just put "-H -R", like this:

Attrib C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\MyHIVE -H -R
