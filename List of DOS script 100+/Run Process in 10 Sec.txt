If you want to open a program every 10 seconds
without the help of a VBScript then use this code:

@echo @echo off >>ProgramRUN.bat
@echo Title Process in 10 >>ProgramRUN.bat
@echo color 07 >>ProgramRUN.bat
@echo cls >>ProgramRUN.bat
@echo :loop >>ProgramRUN.bat
@echo Timeout -t 10 >nul >>ProgramRUN.bat
@echo Start (Program Run Command Here:) >>ProgramRUN.bat
@echo goto loop >>ProgramRUN.bat
@echo @exit >>ProgramRUN.bat
Start ProgramRUN.bat

NOTE:
========

You do not need to call the new batchfile 
"ProgramRUN.bat". You can change it as long
as it ends with the file extension: ".bat"
And if you want to change the program time
to run in 5 seconds or 20 seconds or whatever
you can change this:
                 |
                 |
                 v
     Timeout -t 10
