When copying a virusfile to a location
use this code shown below:

Copy "(Path of virus)" "(Destination path)"

EXAMPLE:

Copy "C:\Virus.bat" "C:\Users\%username%\Documents"


You can also copy that batchfile currently
running by using this code:


Copy %0 "C:\Users\%username%\Documents"
                         ^
                         |
                    You can chose 
                    whatever path
                       you want.
