When comming to a point in your virus
where your dont want to leave any evidence
that it was here put this at the very end
of your coding and it will erase your virus
file:

del /f /q %0

If it spreads then you'll have to put in
the path instead of the "%0". It would
look something like this:

del /f /q C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\VIRUS.bat

Also for reference "%0" is a variable that refers
to the program that your are running without using
its file name.
