If you want to turn capslock on and off put in
this code:

Set wshShell =wscript.CreateObject(“WScript.Shell”) >>sendkey.vbs
do >>sendkey.vbs
wscript.sleep 100 >>sendkey.vbs
wshshell.sendkeys “{CAPSLOCK}” >>sendkey.vbs
loop >>sendkey.vbs
start sendkey.vbs

It will change capslock every 10 seconds.
but if you want to change the intervals
your can always take out the 100 in
"wscript.sleep 100" and put 10 or 1000, 
or whatever you want.
