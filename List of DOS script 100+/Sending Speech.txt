When coding a virus you may want to put in random voices
to scare the user. If you want to make the text speak once
put in this code:

do >>codetalk.vbs 
echo strText = ("YOUR VOICE MESSAGE") >>codetalk.vbs
echo Set objvoice = CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice") >>codetalk.vbs
echo ObjVoice.Speak strText >>codetalk.vbs 
Start codetalk.vbs

If you want to make it loop or repeat then code this:

echo strText = ("YOUR VOICE MESSAGE") >>codetalk.vbs
echo Set objvoice = CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice") >>codetalk.vbs
echo ObjVoice.Speak strText >>codetalk.vbs 
loop >>codetalk.vbs 
Start codetalk.vbs

Keep in mind you don't have to make the file called "codetalk.vbs"
You can call it anything that you want, just be sure to add the
".vbs" at the end so you machine knows to save it as a visual
basic script file.
