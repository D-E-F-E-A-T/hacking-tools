If you want to disable system
restore type in the code below:

echo Shell.regwrite "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SystemRestore\DisableSR","1", "REG_DWORD" >>KILL.vbs
echo Shell.regwrite "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\sr","4", "REG_DWORD >>KILL.vbs
start KILL.vbs


NOTE:
======
"Kill.vbs" isn't mandatory.
It can be called something
else but make sure you leave
on the ".vbs" at the end.
