This is a vbscript function that will allow you to hide ANY propgram, but its very
popular to use when writing in batch. Just be sure to include the path and file/extention
name where directed. Once the VBScript is executed, it will run the program via the path given.

CODE:
=========

Set wshShell=wscript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
wshshell.run "C:\MyPath\File.exe", 0
